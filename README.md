Abstract
The system utilizes a keypad for 
user input and a servo motor for locking and unlocking the door. The system is designed to provide a secure and efficient solution 
for access control in homes and offices. Results from testing show that the system is reliable and easy to use. The system consists 
of a keypad connected to an Arduino board. The Arduino board is programmed to receive inputs from the keypad and activate the 
locking mechanism of the door when the correct code is entered.
